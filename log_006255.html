    <h2><br>from hellen:<br>IN PANIC I SHOT M-1PR. HE WAS SPEEDING TOWARDS ME.<br> SO I SHOT HIM THEN HUNG HIM TO A WALL USING CHAINS.<br> WHEN I SHOT HIM HE BLEED AND EVEY LIMB ON HIS BODY<br> DISCONNECTED. I THOUGHT IT WAS WEIRD HE BLED SINCE<br> THE HUMAN ORGANS IN THE AI IS A NEW THING. HIS<br> TEETH HAD HUMAN BLOOD ALL OVER IT. THE AI BLOOD IS<br> DIFFERENT THEN HUMANS. THE AIS IS ALMOST A PURPLE<br> COLOR BUT THIS BLOOD WAS HUMAN. HUMAN BLOOD ALSO<br> FELL OUT OF THE SHOT MARK NO AI BLOOD. I FOUND OUT<br> THROUGH INVESTIGATING THE AI CORPSE THAT M-1PR HAD<br> BEEN CONSUMING HUMAN BEINGS.
