        OFTEN EXPERIMENT1 IS REFERED AS THE ENTITY SO I<br> THINK THAT EXPERIMENT1 LEFT THE BUILDING. IN FACT<br> WE HAVE GPS TRACKERS INSIDE OF ITS WIRING.<br>
        THE COMPANY LET IT GO BECAUSE ITS PRESENCE WAS<br> MAKING OTHER PROJECTS "FAIL" BUT ITS A<br> DANGER TO SOCIETY. ITS CURENT LOCATION IS A
        <br> FAST FOOD RESTAURANT. IS CALLED MELLO-FILL-A.<br> EXPERIMENTS 8,9,10,AND 11 HAVE RANOFF TO THIS PLACE.<br> IF EXPERIMENT1 GETS ITS HANDS ON EXPERIMENT9
